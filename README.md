# Code-Assessment

Create a simple app that shows a list of books. Each cell should show the title, author, and genre. Tapping on a cell should show a detail page that has an image of the book. There should be a button to filter the book listing by author and genre. There is no API provided so you may hard code some mock data. 

Requirements

•  Scrollable list of books

•  Upon tapping a book cell, a detail screen appears that includes an image. (You can use any random image)

•  Use Pickers to filter books via author and or genre

•  Use SwiftUI / Combine, don’t use any 3rd party libraries
